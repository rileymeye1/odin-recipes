Foundations Course Project: Recipes

This project is to demonstrate the basic HTML skills that I have learned through "The Odin Project" online course.
It will show how to create a repo for a project on GitHub.com and then how to actively update that repo using the Terminal and VSCode.

In this project I will demonstrate the following:

HTML boilerplate
Headings
Emphasis
Strong
File Structure
Links
Images
Ordered Lists
Unordered Lists
