    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Did you know that corn dogs are actually quite easy to make at home? Well, they are! This homemade corn dog recipe is the perfect treat for when you can't make it to the fair or carnival.</p>
    <p>A corn dog is a sausage (usually a hot dog) that has been skewered, coated in a cornmeal batter, and deep-fried. A staple of American cuisine, the street food was likely invented by German immigrants in Texas in the 1920s.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) packages beef frankfurters</li>
        <li>16 wooden skewers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; stir in milk and egg to make a batter.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Meanwhile, pat frankfurters dry and insert a skewer into each one. Roll frankfurters in batter until well coated.</li>
